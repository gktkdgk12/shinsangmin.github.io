  안녕하세요 '몰입 과 해결 하는 것'을 좋아하는 Java & Spring 백앤드 개발자 신상민 입니다.
  
  프로젝트를 성공으로 이끌기위해 남들보다 빠르게 <mark>이슈를 식별하고 대응하고 이를 문서화 하는 자세</mark>로 임하고 있습니다.
  
  또한 홀로 성장보단 **함께 성장**하는 것을 추구하며 모르는 것이 있다면 공부하여 알고자 합니다.
  
  프로젝트를 진행하며 개발단계 로 끝내는 것이 아닌 **실 서비스 운영과 코드를 개선하며 좋은 프로그램을 만들고 싶다.**는 열망이 강하게 자리잡았습니다.
  
  때문에 회사 프로젝트에서 사용중인 프로젝트 관리 서비스를 지속적으로 개선하여 배포하고 사용자의 피드백을 받아 더 나은 서비스를 목표로 개발하고 있습니다.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
